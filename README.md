# Glassmorphic-Login-Page-with-Animated-Background-Preloader
In this project, I created a Glassmorphic Login Page featuring smooth animations and interactive elements. By utilizing CSS, I achieved the Glassmorphism effect, giving the page a frosted-glass appearance that enhances its visual appeal. To ensure a seamless user experience, I incorporated an animated floating background and a custom preloader that keeps users engaged while the page loads.

Key Features:
✨ Glassmorphism Effect: A sleek, modern frosted-glass look.
🎨 Animated Background: Floating particles create a dynamic and engaging backdrop.
⏳ Preloader: A stylish preloader that enhances the user experience during loading.
🌙 Dark Mode: A toggle feature for switching between light and dark themes.

📚 What I Learned:
Glassmorphism in CSS: I delved into creating the trendy frosted-glass effect using backdrop-filter, experimenting with opacity and blurring techniques to craft a stunning UI.
Animated Backgrounds: I utilized the Canvas API to implement an animated particle effect, adding dynamism to the webpage and making the user experience more immersive.
Preloader Creation: I discovered how to add a preloader that enhances the loading experience by displaying a loading animation or image while the page fetches data.
Responsive Design: I ensured the design is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
JavaScript Interactivity: I integrated JavaScript to create a dark mode toggle feature, allowing users to switch between dark and light themes based on their preferences.

🔧 Why This Project?
This project provided an excellent opportunity to apply my CSS skills and explore modern design trends like Glassmorphism. I also learned how to merge JavaScript and CSS for interactive features such as dark mode toggles and background animations. Additionally, I included a preloader to enhance performance and user engagement.
